## Instructions

I have partitioned my project into four main steps :


first:define all Global varibal at the first of the code

second: in this step I am going to loop through all sections and create an ordered list for each section and then grap them into an unorederd list. after doing this I am going to make the magic step which is going to make my code more performance that is called  fragment and then I atached the fragment into navlist and add them into the nav bar automatically.such that it is going to add the same number of sections in the page below at the navbar.

third:the biggest mission is to add active class to the section which is in the viewport. by using getboundingrect i am going to specify the top,right,bottom,left,width,and hight of the section which is in the viewport. I used scroll to event to change the active class as well as the user scroll into the page.

fourth:I've added a button in the very bottom in right below to go back to the top as well as I've moved to 
the bottom.

some resources :
I have taken some styles of css and learned some new conceptes about how to hidden the navbar form w3school
